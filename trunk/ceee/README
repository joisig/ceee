CEEE is an acronym for Chrome Extensions Execution Environment. It s
an optional feature of Chrome Frame that acts as an adapter layer for
a subset of the Chrome Extension APIs. This enables extensions that
stick to the supported subset of APIs to work in the context of Chrome
Frame with minimal or sometimes no changes.
